Why another one? Short answer, I want one developed in Go way, not just in Go.

This project is designed to open to any Geocoding service. All you need to do is following Google or MapQuest implementations provided to write yours in 50 LoC. In fact, copy then change ~20 out of the 50 lines is more accurate.
